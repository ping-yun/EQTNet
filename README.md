Efficient Quantized Transformer Network for EEG Emotion Recognition

Our model combines two quantitative methods, quantization based on weighted mean subtraction for weights and elastic quantization based on learning parameters for EEG signal. Experiments on two public datasets (SEED and SEEDIV) show that our model has good performance. The highest accuracy is 97.14% on the SEED dataset and 89.90% on the SEEDIV dataset.
